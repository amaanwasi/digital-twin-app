# Digital Twin Health Model

This project contains a clinically-guided digital twin model for processing Apple Watch, ECG, and subjective health data. It provides personalized risk flags, recommendations, and clinical summaries.

## ðŸ“¦ Files
- `digital_twin_model.py`: Main application file
- `medical_knowledge_base.json`: Contains structured ICD/NICE/Mayo/LOINC-based logic

## âœ… How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

2. Run the program:
```bash
python digital_twin_model.py
```

It generates synthetic data, simulates health analysis, and prints a personalized clinical summary and recommendations.

## ðŸ§  Medical Knowledge
This model uses embedded knowledge from:
- ICD-11
- NICE Clinical Guidelines
- Mayo Clinic logic (converted to rules)
- LOINC for vitals and labs
- Custom internal medical ontologies

All results are explained in natural, human-friendly language.
